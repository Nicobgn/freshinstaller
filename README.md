# Fresh Install Script
I'm too lazy to search for every single package that \
I need so I created a script to run on a fresh install. 

Before anyone send something, yes, I have some dotfiles but \
I will not share them since I can leak some password or something \
by accident so... \

I hope this would help someone lazy like me lol.

## Development
The scripts also offers installation of a few development tools \
and languages, such as:
| Type | Name |
| ---- | ---- |
| Terminal | [Z shell](https://www.zsh.org) |
| Terminal Framework | [Oh-My-Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh) |
| IDE | [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org) |
| Language | [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) |
| Language | [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) |

## Window Managers
